  This is the final project for Linguistic 269: Swearing And Taboo Language at the University of Washington. 
Here we are trying to analyze which swear word and in what context that these swear words seems the most tabooness, on a rating scale from 1, not taboo at all, to 7, the most taboo.
We primarily looked if gender played a part in a swear word's tabooness.
We first administered the project using a Google Survey Form that had all the swear words used in three different sentences each in different context and which one seems the most taboo out of all of them.
And using the data collected, we made graphs to represent our results from 26 randomly selected participates, which can be viewed by this link: https://prachatornjoe.shinyapps.io/Ling_269_Final_Project/.
